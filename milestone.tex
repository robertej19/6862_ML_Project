Title
Abstract
\section{Introduction (including related work) }
(we can now site Stan's work!)
\section{Methods}
We should include our work of generating the data (GEMC) and processing the data (convert to root, pandas, pickle) as these are all non-trivial steps and a good "data pipeline"
\section{Preliminary Results}
Preliminary results, Github repo, data, code correctness, readability: 8 points - Do they want snippets of code in here??
